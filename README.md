# Getting Started with Vue 3 and Vite using pnpm

Vue.js has become one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building modern web applications. Vue 3, the latest version of the framework, comes with various enhancements and improvements to make development even more delightful. Vite, on the other hand, is a fast development build tool that helps you build Vue applications quickly. 

In this tutorial, we will explore how to set up and run a Vue 3 and Vite project using pnpm as the package manager, with a focus on using the development server for easy development.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. Node.js (v14 or above)
2. pnpm

If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally using npm with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Step 1: Clone the Project

Let's begin by cloning the project from GitHub. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razorcx/vue3-vite-tailwind-blog-template.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the project as a zip archive and extract it to a local directory.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your working directory to the root of the project that you just cloned:

```bash
cd vue3-vite-tailwind-blog-template
```

## Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Now, we need to install the project dependencies using pnpm. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Step 4: Run the Development Server

With the project dependencies installed, it's time to start the development server. Vite comes with an integrated development server that provides fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and instant updates. To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The development server will now compile the project and automatically open it in your default web browser. You will see your Vue 3 and Vite application up and running.

## Step 5. Customize the Project

   Now that you have the template running, you can start customizing it to fit your specific needs:

   - **Update the Blog Content**: Replace the placeholder blog content in the `src/App.vue` file with your actual blog posts. Modify the `posts` array in the `fetchPosts` function to fetch your own data from an API or use a local data source.

   - **Add New Components**: Create new Vue components inside the `src/components` directory as needed. Import and use these components in the `App.vue` file or any other components.

   - **Modify Styles**: Customize the styles by adding or editing CSS classes in the `src/styles` directory. The template already uses Tailwind CSS, so you can leverage its utility classes to style your components easily.

   - **Add Routes**: If you want to create a multi-page blog, you can set up Vue Router to manage different routes for different sections of your blog. Install Vue Router and define your routes in a separate file.

   - **Configure Vite**: If you need to configure Vite further, you can do so in the `vite.config.js` file. For example, you might need to set up aliases for easier imports or customize the build output.


## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to set up and run a Vue 3 and Vite project using pnpm as the package manager. We leveraged the built-in development server to enjoy fast HMR and live reloading, making the development process smooth and efficient.

Feel free to customize the project according to your requirements and start building amazing Vue applications with Vue 3 and Vite!
